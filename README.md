# Implimenting A Dense Quadratic layer from scratch

In this Notebook I have Implimented a Dense layer from scratch which has transformation equation of Z = WT1.X^2 + WT2.X + b , which is inherently a non-Linear transformation.

## Results

On a single Neuron instance I was able to achive an improvment of 0.9% in accuracy
